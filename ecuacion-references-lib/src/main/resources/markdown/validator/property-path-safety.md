## Overview

Class-level validators (`@XxxWhen`, `@GreaterThan`/`@LessThan`, `@AnyNotNull`, etc.) reference fields
through string attributes such as `propertyPath`, `conditionPropertyPath`, `conditionValuePropertyPath`,
and `baselinePropertyPath`. These strings are resolved via reflection when validation runs, so if a
referenced field is renamed, the compiler cannot catch the mismatch — Java annotation elements must be
compile-time constants, so a type-safe field reference (a method reference, a `KProperty`-like handle)
cannot be used here.

This page describes two practical ways to catch a broken `propertyPath` early anyway.

---

## Mitigation 1: One Validation Test per Annotated Class

Every field-reference string above is resolved unconditionally, on every `validate()` call, regardless
of the field's value. `ClassValidator.internalIsValid` resolves all `propertyPath` values before
delegating to the validator's own logic, and `ValidateWhenValidator.getSatisfiesCondition` resolves
`conditionPropertyPath` (and `conditionValuePropertyPath`, when `VALUE_OF_PROPERTY_PATH` is used) the
same way. If any of these strings no longer names a real field, resolution throws a `RuntimeException`
— independent of what the test data actually contains.

This means a single test that calls `Validator#validate` once against an instance of the annotated
class is enough to catch a rename: if the test still passes, every `propertyPath` referenced by that
class's annotations still resolves.

```java
class UserProfileValidationTest {

  @Test
  void validatorPropertyPathsResolve() {
    Validator validator = Validation.buildDefaultValidatorFactory().getValidator();
    // The field values don't matter: this test exists only to force every
    // propertyPath / conditionPropertyPath / conditionValuePropertyPath referenced by
    // UserProfile's annotations to be resolved once, so a rename breaks the build.
    validator.validate(new UserProfile());
  }
}
```

Points to keep in mind:

- The test data's content is irrelevant — the test exists purely to trigger field resolution.
- If any annotation on the class specifies `groups`, pass that group explicitly to `validate()`;
  otherwise that annotation is skipped and its `propertyPath` is not resolved.
- One test per annotated class is enough. There is no need to cover every annotation instance
  separately, since all of a class's `propertyPath`s are resolved together on every call.

## Mitigation 2: Compile-Time-Checked Field Names

Instead of writing field names as raw string literals, reference them through generated constants (for
example Lombok's `@FieldNameConstants`, or a hand-written constants class). A field rename then breaks
the constant reference at compile time, before the test above even runs.

```java
@FieldNameConstants
public record UserProfile(String name, Dept dept) {}

@NotEmptyWhen(
    propertyPath = UserProfile.Fields.name,
    conditionPropertyPath = "...",
    ...
)
```

For nested paths (e.g. `"dept.name"`), only the individual segments can be constant references; the
`.` separator still has to be a literal:

```java
propertyPath = UserProfile.Fields.dept + "." + Dept.Fields.name
```

This does not require any change to `ecuacion-lib-validation` itself — it is purely an
application-side coding convention.

## Which One to Use

| Approach | When the mismatch is caught | Cost |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ---- |
| Mitigation 1 (validation test) | Test run (e.g. in CI) | Low — one test per annotated class |
| Mitigation 2 (field name constants) | Compile time | Medium — needs a constants mechanism (e.g. Lombok) adopted project-wide |

The two are complementary rather than exclusive: Mitigation 1 is cheap enough to add regardless, and
Mitigation 2 is worth adopting on top of it when the project already has (or is willing to add) a
field-name-constant convention.
